photo_sort
==========

This scripth allows you to sort your photos/videos basing on date of creation and type of the file. 
You can specify folder where to search and root folder to copy to.
Script fill scan all files below for EXIF date of creation, if there is no exif it will take system time 
of creation of your photo of video.
YOu can also specify minimum amount of files required to create a seperate folder. 
For example if on 25th of february 2013 you have 5 elements, but you have choose to create folder for 6 minimum,
then all files will be copied to folder abow, if folder abow doesn't have enought files it will go uppeer.
Script will sort all files in the directory, 
so if you have other type of files exept photo or video it will sort them too.
